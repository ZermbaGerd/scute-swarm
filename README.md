Scute Swarm is a self-replication library for CC:Tweaked turtles rooted in MerlinLikeTheWizard's [strategy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MXYZufNQtdQ). Turtles mine for resources, grow sugarcane and plant trees, and craft a copy of themselves which repeats the process. They can, mostly, keep track of where in the program's flow they are when they are unloaded/reloaded.


## How to Use
Take a look at INSTALLATION.md for guidance on downloading and enabling ComputerCraft.

Once that's done, re-enter the world and place down a Miney Crafting Turtle (a turtle equipped with a diamond pickaxe and a crafting table). Place 1 piece of Sugar Cane, 2 Birch Saplings, 1 Lava Bucket, and 1 Crafting Table into its inventory. Then, you can run this command to download the installer for the program: 
    
    wget "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ZermbaGerd/scute-swarm/refs/heads/main/scripts/installer.lua" installer

Then, run the installer program by just typing `installer` into the command line.

Once the installer has been run, you can run `main` to begin the program. It will repeat indefinitely.

## Notes

**ComputerCraft** is a mod for Minecraft which adds computers which are programmable with the Lua programming language. **ComputerCraft: Tweaked** is a fork of the mod for newer Minecraft versions.

Think about the reading we did on "axes" of AI
- Where do we want to be, roughly, on these axes?
    - For instance - do we want to have multiple agents? do we want them to be able to actively interact with each other? should there be shared memory between them?


Wesley has gotta get VS Code - we'll get bro set up (shouldn't take more than like an hour)

Also we should get Wesley a minecraft account for computer - it's like 25 bucks and i'm happy to pitch in like 10 bucks

Apparently chunk-loading is pretty important for turtles (they forget stuff that's being stored in a program when the world shuts down, and I think also when they enter unloaded chunks.)
- we should be aware of that if we start having turtles that might leave our area


Are we going to use outside libraries?
- the guy who I linked a video of has made a pretty extensive turtle-control library, but I'm worried it might trivialize a lot of the things that would make developing this interesting
